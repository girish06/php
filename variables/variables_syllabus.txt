gettype
=================
get the type of variable(eg.. boolean,string etc)


import_request_variables  -Needs work 
========================
 â€” Import GET/POST/Cookie variables into the global scope


intval
=======================
get the integer value of the variable.
should not be used to varaiable holding the object value which throws the error.

is_array
======================
Check the variable is array or not

is_bool
======================
check the variable has the boolean value.

is_callable
===========================
it checks the varaible is holding any functioin name
its checks the variable is holding any object or any method within the object

it has three parameteres

1. varaible name
2. bool value - True or false : 
   validates the the value is valid function or method and simply rejects the improper structure
   two possible that one is valid function or string and second is string.
3. callable name.

is_double or is_float
====================
checks the variable is float or not

is_int or is_integer or is_long
===============================
checks the variable is integer or not

is_null
===========================
check the variable is null or not.

is_object
==========================
checks the variable is object or not.

is_resource
========================
checks the resource is avaible or not. eg. file,  // needs work

is_scalar
=======================
check the variable is scalar type of string,float,integer 
remaining datatypes are not considered as scalar types.

is_string
=======================
check the variable contains the string value if not it will return as false.

isset
=======================
check the variable is declared.
if variable is declared and if its holding the value NULL. Then its return false.

print_r
=======================
gives the output of the variable that in human readable format.

serialize
======================
gives the value in storable representation of value.
which can transmitted over a network,  stored in file.

settype:
=====================
set the datatype to the variable.

strval
====================

converts any scalar value to string. [scalar is an integer, string, float].
we cannot use array or object and incase applied returns the type name of the value being converted.

unset
==================
destroy the varible.

var_dump
==================

gives information about the variable.
arrays and objects are explored 

var_export
==================

php varibales:

boolval
=================
Rules:

integer - 0 is always false
float   - 0.0 is always false
string  - 0 and empty string is always false
array   - empty array is false and remaining values are true
object  - null is always is false and everything is true 
null    - null is alwaysss


debug_zval_dump
==================


returns the string value along with along with count value  and how many times the varible has been referenced
reference is used by the symbol &.

doubleval
==================
alias of floatval

floatval
==================
returns the float value of the variable

case 1: values appended at the right
case 2: values appended at the left

floatval should not be passed with object

empty
=================
check the variable has value or not 
check the variable has empty or not
 
zero is conisdered as empty either as integer or as in string
0.0 is considered as emptyu
NULL is considered as empty   // It should be without string
FALSE is considered as empty  // It should be without string
empty array is considered as empty

get_defined_vars
=================
returns an array defined varibales

get_resource_type
==================
get resource type like mysql ,  stream,  document etc // not working
